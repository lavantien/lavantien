I build systems, tools, and agents that ship.

<details>
<summary><b>What I Do</b></summary>

**Backend & Distributed Systems**: Production experience with Go, C#, Scala, C++, and Rust. Expertise in gRPC (Protobuf, Avro) and REST APIs with OpenAPI generation. Proficient in SQLite, Postgres, Mongo, and Redis using SQLc/SQLx, along with NATS/RabbitMQ message queues. Focused on code quality: enforcing high coverage (99-100% coverage achievable) via unit, integration, and E2E tests with strict linting. Skilled in concurrency patterns, Docker Compose, the Grafana stack, NGINX load balancing, and SRE principles.

**Agentic Engineering**: Eval harnesses ([`llm-tournament`](https://github.com/lavantien/llm-tournament)), RAG pipelines, agent architectures. Focused on reproducibility, cost control, and measuring what actually matters.

**Algorithms & Tools**: From competitive programming implementations (genetic algorithms, FFT, graph theory) to practical tooling (CLI scrapers, PDF archivers, developer automation).

**Full-Stack When Needed**: React, Svelte, Angular, TypeScript. Not my primary focus, but I ship complete features end-to-end.
